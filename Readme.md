## Discord Bot

This is a discord that has integrated the model text-davinci-003 from OpenAI. It is a bot that can generate text based on a prompt

it has 2 commands:

- !generate ``:prompt`` 
- !gpt ``:prompt`` 

the difference between the two is that the first one uses  more tokens and the second one uses less tokens, so the second one is faster but the first one is more accurate

also you can chat with the bot withouth using the commands, just ask your question and the bot will answer
